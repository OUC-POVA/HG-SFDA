🎯 **Goal:** Existing methods normally exploit the pair-wise relation among target samples and attempt to discover their correlations by clustering these samples based on semantic features. The drawbacks of these methods include: 1)~the pair-wise relation is limited to exposing the underlying correlations of two more samples, hindering the exploration of the structural information embedded in the target domain; and 2)~the clustering process only relies on the semantic feature, while overlooking the critical effect of domain shift, \ie, the distribution differences between the source and target domains."

🧠 **Core Idea:** We propose a new SFDA method that exploits the high-order neighborhood relation and explicitly takes the domain shift effect into account. Specifically, we formulate the SFDA as a hypergraph learning problem and construct hyperedges to explore the {deep structural} and context information among multiple samples. Moreover, we integrate a self-loop strategy into the constructed hypergraph to elegantly introduce the domain uncertainty of each sample. By clustering these samples based on hyperedges, both the semantic feature and domain shift effects are considered. We then describe an adaptive relation-based objective to tune the model with soft attention levels for all samples."

### 🔍 Key Contributions  
- **High-order Relation Modeling:**  Different from the existing pair-wise relation-based methods, \eg, NRC, AaD, SF(DA)$^{2}$, we formulate SFDA as a hypergraph learning problem and explore the high-order neighborhood relations to excavate the underlying structural information.
- **Self-Loop:** With the constructed hypergraph, we design a novel self-loop strategy to elegantly involve the domain shift into optimization.
- **Adaptive Scheme:** We describe an adaptive learning scheme to enhance the mainstream objectives by considering different attention levels.
